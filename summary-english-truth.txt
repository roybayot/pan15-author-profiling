And ending with a twist. A new begining I guess.		That was the biggest mistake of my life. Yes I made mistake and only myself to blame for it.		Each of them was mistake. And I cannot argue about it.		And now the dice is rolling once again. Only someone from future can tell me if I am getting into the same problem once again. I hope not.		My fav Pappa @username has taken Vardhaan to a new height. If Don was grt, Vardhaan was the perfect  antagonist.		RT @username: i smell victory. #Aus179/8		All tweples are insomniac. I want to sleep as well.

When you spend most of the day in office, you will know that you are upto something.		Twitter changes again... not bad though..		Love is a lost art.		So many days with all different names. Does the ""Love day"" exist? I think that is missing in the merchandising of products.		Late enough for a sleep.. But so many things to do still.. I am enjoying my late nights at office.		5 students now. May be I should be prepared with some proper syllabus now.		Measuring the depth of life...		Feeling the need for a long holiday. But have to listen to him who never stops doing his job.		I think it is high time to forget and forgive.		If you don't trust your lover, you are not confident of yourself.		The more you want to hold onto something, the more you risk loosing it. Love is no exception.		Loosing your cool for nothing is not a good thing.		6th student here with unique problem.

It has always felt better to be reconnected with old friends. Forgetting the past and moving onto the future.		Coming to end of a almost non stop journey from yesterday. and that is in bus. no sleep in last 33 hours. Need some urgently.		A timeless day. 10hrs sleep after 40hrs gap and 14 hrs of journey in the dusty roads in between.		I like to play with fire, but am I old now to stop playing?		It's very very the last the day.

Where I end and you begin.		It's you and me, it's always been, And how I feel about you there's no end.		Living is easy with eyes closed.		One Direction está en Kansas... @username TE LARGAS A BUSCARLOS AHORA MISMO!!		A heart of stone can turn to clay.		Open up your mind and you will feel it too, the sound, the touch, the thoughts, that you've been so blind to.		Dream big or don't dream at all.		I've tried to ask myself, should I see someone else? I wish I knew the aaaanswer...		And if our final day has come, let's pretend to carry oooon!		The only thing I ever wanted, was the feeling that you ain't faking.		I'd rather be good than lucky.		Fifty fifty.		Qué wonito eres :))		So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable?		Quiero ver a Never shout never aunque sea muy 2011 &lt;33		On Saturday I know that you’re coming up to see me, when I go away things will change and you’ll never know it was easy.		She don't call me one and only, she just calls me when she gets lonely, something I do gets her there so feel better and get well...		Perfect in every way, I see it in his face.		Act like I don't need her but... You, you're necessary. ????		No puedo creer que Ariana Grande sea novia de Jai Domenic &lt;3 awwwwwwww dlahgaklsgñhslkghsaklgs		You got me right where you want me.		It's getting hard to be around you, there's so much I can't say, do you want me to hide the feelings and look the other way.		Money's a bitch that never sleeps.		I put my faith in something unknown.		So done with wishing you were still here.		When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep... Historia de mi vida.		Hoy fui a Danoninear. ????		SI AUUUUUUN TE AMOOOOOO SI AUUUUUN TE EXTRAÑOOO LOS DIAS SIN TI SON COMO MORIR, AUUUUUUUUU UH UH UH UH UUUN TE EXTRAÑO		TSEA TOY EN CHOK!		Only you can fill that space inside... #IYKWIM		Here I go again on my own going down the only road I've ever known		She's a slave to the rhythm.		Baby take me on a journey, I've been thinking lately, I could use a little time alone with you...		And he doesn't give a damn about me.		Lose yourself to dance.		Her-minion. http://t.co/QPBsEZYHjJ		ME LLEVA LA CONCHA QUE ME PARIÓ. ALGUIEN HAGAME EL FAVOR Y MÁTEME.		LARGATE ARANGO LARGATE CONCHA DE TU MADRE		TOTAL, NI QUERÍA IR A BRASIL, ESTOY MAS MISIA QUE LA CONCHA!		Every little thing he does is magic, everything he do just turns me on.		There's one life, one world, one chance and I don't wanna wait.		I hope you're not lonely without me.		If I could spend the rest of my life with my people, I would do it over and over again.		They tried to make me go to rehab but I said no no no...		@username JEJE FAV.		So wake me up when it's all over, when I'm wiser and I'm older.		I speak a different language, but I still hear your call.		Is that what devils do?		Let me live that fantasy!		Take me to the place where you go, where nobody knows if it's night or day.		No inventes.		I think I'm falling for you.		"

You need a real woman in your life.		There was a time, I thought, that you did everything right.. No lies, no wrong, boy, I must’ve been outta my mind.		When I think of the time that I almost loved you, you showed your ass and I saw the real you.		You don’t deserve my tears, I guess that’s why they ain’t there.		We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still.		Love yourself girl, or nobody will.		Her mind is on a different level.		She fuck, she suck, she swallow man, it's like a triple double.		Can see it in your eyes, you look for trouble.		Just because they fuck ya, girl, don't mean them niggas love ya.		Mama couldn't never reach her. Brother tried his best to teach her.

Sudan, Uganda, Cambodia. (genocides) Yang Xinhai, Ramadan Mansour, Luis Garavito. (mass murderers)		@username Doesn't matter much. Plenty of them support it. Current 'alpha males' didn't start patriarchy either.		@username @username @username It's not about the money. It's about promising 1 video a month and only delivering 4 vids in 2 years.		No, PC Advisor. Inkjet printers do NOT fall under the category of color laser printers... http://t.co/qt1Apjcd76		And no, @username. Anything that has a sticker saying ""Xerox"" is not an HP Officejet. Nor is the 8100 a laser printer. http://t.co/cYSFi4GEns		@username I'm really saddened that you have macro photos of tablet screens, test photos on phones, but no sample scans for printers.		@username He has a tiny point but misses the parts where reviews drive purchases, and where letsplays are transformative in nature.		I really quite like it that Red Bull will just up and fund stuff like Danny MacAskill's Imaginate: http://t.co/Njw81iVzjy via @username		@username @username Availability of old/obscure/quirky/bad games is not a bad thing. The prominence and promotion of those games is.		It sucks when your phone suddenly won't read a simcard any more. It sucks even more when your PC breaks while looking for a solution. =(		@username Hurray for Dutch sportsball, huh?		@username I was on @username and noticed all the 3d models work just fine on my Nexus 7. *thumbs up* for crossplatform functionality!		The current @username bundle is worth it just for @username 's fantastic Pineapple Smash Crew.		Today, fear soaked fabric as over 50 victims suffered a gruesome fate. My wardrobe shrunk from 100cm to only 57cm. (1/3)		Among the casualties are 6 tops, 18 tees, 10 longsleeves, 8 dress shirts, 5 pants, 6 shorts and a suit. (2/3)		Just saw fireworks in the #netherlands , wondering if it's for #fifaworldcup #BRAvsCOL or some U.S. expats celebrating #IndependenceDay		@username Man, what a waste of a tweet, talking about responses you don't like... You could have spent it on making a ""WTF is?"" video ;)		@username But today is not that day!! http://t.co/V0y7Dpp3XM		@username because its spelled ""Götze"" and 'oe' is the internationally accepted spelling when you don't have access to diacritics.		@username is this in response to the recent gamasutra article / FTC quote?		Bought a new PC with Windows 8.1 hoping it wouldn't be so bad now with the updates. After a day I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown... =(		Seriously. Who had the idea to replace the standard calculator by a full screen app? I don't need 1920x1200 to multiply some numbers.		@username @username Instead you want these. Chocolate/marzipan/sugarsprinkles. Don't know the English name. http://t.co/znQjgxeIav		@username Yeah I've been looking into similar things, like the stuff from @username. Not sure what I end up choosing yet.		@username Also, W8.1 apparently has regular calc, but also an appified version (as default) for added confusion and frustration.*sigh*		@username Definitely gonna give it a try. Seems to be the most feature rich one, and I love the price of free.		@username Right now? I don't really know. There's no way to disable the metro bit (outside of 3rd party (cont) http://t.co/7zMcs94hQM		@username Pix or it didn't happen. (Or linx)		@username Maybe they're taking the adage ""all publicity is good publicity"" a tad too literal?		@username @username Heh. I like how they call Forbes 'unprofessional'. It's only a century old business magazine, after all.		Well, #Dota2TI4 championship final was a bit of a letdown... Very one-sided, almost like the Brazil  #FIFA2014 matches earlier this month.		@username How come NL/EU prices for businesses are so skewed? I almost understand $140 -&gt; €140 But there's no way $400 should -&gt; €540($727)		Statistics! Colors! Games! Graphs! Numbers! Info! Money! Jerbs! Exclamation Marks! http://t.co/hveVXSCr9V #gamedev		@username Ooh. Freddie Mercury! I loved his music in Neverending Story as well. But why is that Spiderman quote in there?		@username Your bundle currently costs. ?€ I thought that was funny.		@username Remember when you mentioned RU-UA-EU war? It's already happening on kickstarter, according to Areal! http://t.co/Tqbsyc9eSC		This is a good looking kickstarter! https://t.co/9EmXuUuNd2 Love the vid and the header gifs. (oh and the game itself looks interesting too)		I wouldn't hurt the proverbial fly, but those damn mosquitos... Just killed at least two dozen of the bitey fuckers.		@username With you being you, I'm not sure if that's ASAP or never.		How come art software always has such a shitty GUI? I'd assume that designers would understand/appreciate usability.		@username Will this work with the regular PC forum accounts or do we have to make new ones? Would be handy to have that integrated.		@username Gotta be honest here, these sprites feel kind of blurry and lacking detail. A downside of 3d, or maybe a render/filter issue?		@username Can hardly wait for PC version X. What I've gathered there are a bunch of small visual tweaks and a lot of under-the-hood work.		@username Yeah I know they're 2x. I scaled the image down to 50% first to check my gut. Does ingame have normals or something?		@username I just finished my last game for the day, this should be a nice way to unwind.		@username @username It really depends on the quality of the stuff, much like chocolate. Often I find they add too much powder, too.		I... Uh... what? Dafuq?
https://t.co/VT0eMJofYN		@username Don't worry. You will be surgeried by only the most pro of fessionals. http://t.co/c8qaZNjW3L		@username How are the podcasts rubbish? Only thing edited for (the YT version of) that are the commercials, right?		@username I get the removal of streamed 'regular' music, I do. But background music from games? And beyond that, do you think that (1/2)		@username it should apply to games in general? (textures+models+etc=©, too) You generally say that streaming is a transformative art.		@username Technically, this is a mobile game. And I'm not sure I would call this 'playing'.		Yup, salticidae are definitely the bestest, coolest and most awesomest spiders.

https://t.co/Wr1elzCRf4		@username No. You'd be wasting far too much time debugging variables, when such a simple command is all you need.		@username Ooh. Sanchez. I strongly approve of this.		@username @username @username I'm in that camp. Everyone* has a smartphone now, which makes it a true -personal- computer.		@username @username The biggest problem with round robin is a lack of focus. Sports thrive on spectators. (semi)Finals get more views.		@username @username Says it right there ""? The Jester Race
A song by In Flames""		@username @username Given that you regularly do long takes, though, this one felt ""slighly off"". (j/k well done Zooc)		@username Lamb allergy is a pretty lame allergy.		@username I think you're mixing up Gone Home and Dear Esther. Not many people argued Gone Home wasn't a game, just not a GOOD one.		@username I think you should do a combination. Good projects deserve love, but also one/sporadic supercut of bad to keep people warned.		@username It might work to have a few bad trailers at the start of each vid? Nope, nope, nope, this looks decent.		@username @username @username Hurrah! You didn't call it the A/S/L challenge. +1 for knowing the actual charity's name.		@username @username Heck, look at people lighting up torches and pitchforks after spending just a few hundred dollars on a gaming box...		@username AND DOLLA DOLLA BILLS YO. (also my shirt)		@username @username http://t.co/LrtfFdiNqJ seems kind of relevant in this case too. From several perspectives.		@username You're right on the first account. Many would argue about the 2nd; the nature of  debates is divisive. http://t.co/E4kkt588dH		@username What's the crest for that?		@username That actually seems interesting data, yeah. I wonder if there's some kind of metrics script for that.		Using your phone can be dangerous even if you're not driving. Sorry mr snail...		@username Liking youtubers isn't a problem either. Which leaves ""harassing"" as the only issue.		@username Threat? Or... treat?		Simple yet clear marking of gluten/lactose/vegetarian/etc foods. Good on you, Germany. http://t.co/W62Wy4yIyr		@username I know, right. You're actually complain about framerates and texture quality most of the time.		@username For me, personally, it's like a TV show. I can relax to it because it's more passive than articles, yet is not supershort.		@username @username Quite an innovative new 'exclusive' system; just exclude yourself from a lot of games.Wonder where this will go?		@username @username You mean ""asshole"" culture, within the gaming and internet audience, right? I'm pretty sure that's what you mean.		@username @username @username Should the flooding work that way? Don't you need 2 holes; one for water in, one for air out?		@username Dual monocles and tophat for maximum gentlemanliness.		@username Jim, try Monster Rehab. It's not nearly as sugary as regular (about 25%) but it doesn't taste like deat-... I mean sweeteners.		@username @username Unless your licence gets voided, in which case you pay €35 AND €70. Personally, I just wait for price drops.		@username @username And what if it gets voided before you managed to install/play?		@username @username It was a hypothetical. Hence why he says ""at your own risk"". It might work fine, it might cost you.		@username Definitely think that you do 3 can stop early. A game has max 20 minutes, if it impresses you sooner, good on it.		@username @username Ooh, this is pretty. Any info on how it's done? Looks like uprezzed render, sure, but any special texture approach?		@username What, you're able to not hate someone you disagree with? Is this some kind of magic? Are you a wizerds?		@username @username It is rather uncanny... http://t.co/EzJMUWrtS0		Just binge-read the entirety of @username's comic. It's gooood. http://t.co/jVOCCOc5fp		@username @username With 300+ employees, they're well past the 'Dunbar number'; a group of ~150 is what our human brains can manage.		Didn't know I, a European, could send emails about net neutrality to US Gov. EUROPEANS UNITE! http://t.co/iJssKlF3rJ http://t.co/11MWt6BLo7		@username I've always likened Dear Esther to a book or movie. You can press play/pause, but you don't really have any agency.		@username Personally, I'd love physical media as an option, if it were JUST that. But most games nowadays are just a DVD + steam code.		@username Next bundle? http://t.co/OJ7iOFedwb		@username you have your own NPC and you're giving out games? CONSPIRACYYY!!!!		@username @username @username He's an author at Destructoid. He IS games media.

Now we play the wait for my stop game		Think I might be changing my bus route		Organize and alphabetize all day #worktweet		I never meant to hurt anyone, I just didn't want to hurt anymore either.		The lonely stoner seems to free her mind at night.		Fuck the past few days.		I could really go for some coffee right now, but I think I'll settle for a bowl instead		""Yeah? You too pal!"" Could be one of my catch phrases #brooklynborn		Toll bridge trolls need to eat too.		Today the paychecks come in, and even though I can't deposit until tomorrow morning, I can't fucking wait!!		Seems like I should have my #jawboneup back finally!! Boo yah!		Upgrading my room		She always calls right when I'm getting ready to leave for work -.-		Lol, word? Aight then.		Shaken my ass while I hit the bong, cause it makes me feel so damn good		There's still some hood rat in me.		Time to slip on something a little more comfortable and hit the bong.		Don't need saving, cause there's no salvation for a bad girl		3and a half hours till I can get back to where I wanna be.		Cabin in the Woods. ????		Fuck yes to this movie. Simply that. Fuck yes.		#Elysium was pretty cool ????		Oh my god, I wish I could figure out what I did to my left shoulder/arm, cause it hurts like a motherfucker!!		I hate these games....		Do what you will.		Looks like I'll be taking the bus a lot more		Woke up to some static and stress  rewind. Think Im'a wake up to a bowl instead.		@username see, what he had meant to say is ""when a Child is bad"" but what he Had said is ""when a Person is bad""		Ey!! Neighborhood rules apply!!

Right after my bus left.		So now I'm waiting 20 minutes for the next bus.		Wow. Fuck you and your bad manners		So ready to be home already		I'm just blowin in the wind.		Ready for the worst.		Well I feel sufficiently stupid.		Whatever. I'm done bothering for now ????		Almost put my stuff I'm the wrong grinder, whoops! Lol		I'm smirken sooooo hard. Fuck that. Laughing. This deserves a bowl it's so damn glorious.		Coughing my ass off, the ""I'm Getting High"" alarm is sounding		Decided to make a coconut pastry cream tart topped with mango, pineapple, papaya, lychee, etc. for mom's birthday ????		Sitting here trying to figure out what this all means...		I'm just gonna sit here and wish you missed me too...		He speaks in terms of centuries.		Time to get ready for work.		Made the arrangements for my moms birthday like a responsible adult.		Still got 40 minutes before the market opens so I can grab the last of what I need		Just enough time to get high ????		I am in love with this baby pink lipstick I just got yesterday!! ????????????????		Retail people love me. When I go into a store I know precisely what I want, exactly what I'm asking for, and I've already decided to buy it.		Today is my mothers birthday. #queenleo ????#AllHailTheQueen ????????????????		Time to get my ass up and back on track. But first this message from our cannabinoid receptors!		Whatever		So glad to be home and reaching for the Bong.		I'm so tired, but got so much to do ????		Trying to remember who I was ????		Fuck yeah new ghost adventures today!		Ugh. Put my favorite lipstick through the wash. Still usable though. But really, lesson learned.		Trust my least favorite manager to fuck up my chances at catching the bus that would have had me home already		At least they were teaching me to serve beer and wines today :) ????????		Up late. Up early. A protein rich breakfast before I smoke a bowl. #getfit		My goals have evolved.		I don't give a fuck how tired you are, this is where anxiety can take you #insomnia #sleepplease		Soooo sore and exhausted.		I'll just be grateful I'm hereto hit this bong and that I've got this bong to hit.		I'm in so much fucking pain.		Can't decide if I'm gonna just hit the bing and grab on to some sleep, or grab some munching a first		I'm leaning toward ""Bong"" #Truth		There's a piggy off my coast of the bed, snuffling for skritches ????		THC, then protein, then get stoned out of my mind #morningswithmcfly		Increasing my intake. I'm tired of not being enough.		New #GAC just in time for me to enjoy before I head to work? yes Yes YES!!!		Ugh. Can't even right now.		It wouldn't even be a big deal if I wasn't so fucking hungry.		I can now serve beer, wines and some of our signature cocktails! ????????????????????		Started at the bottom but I'm coming up like a beast.		I missed my intended early bus, so I hit the bong instead		Ughhhh my luck &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;		Haven't even gotten to work and I desperately need a shower and to wash my clothes already, if that says anything about my day so far...		The good thing about having luck like mine is its helped make my outlook this:		It's a bummer for the first 30 seconds, then there's not much point in anything but laughing it off and planning the next step.		Nice karmic turn around though with a free bus ride ????		The stench of Red Bull		Dozed on the mat for a good 15 minutes		Living down the block from the high school means I get to listen to the marching band start fucking up bright and early. ????		Had my protein and got started on cleaning the kitchen. It's time for some rips before anything else though.		Reminds me of you		I feel sick right now		I'm just gonna hit the bong and forget		Work 3 hours later than I expected. Shazam!		Damn it's cold in my store. Wish I hadn't forgotten my hoodie today -.-		God my head is killing me. Maybe I should eventually eat something today.		I think I put my finger on what's bothering me		Work in 11 hours		Ugh, can't figure out why my eyes keep tearing up these past weeks.		"

So... I've 15 years left for mine?		@username your new discussion layout is confusing regarding who says what, because the comments aren't sectioned off. http://t.co/Dfkg4js2o2		I never really understood why game environments (which you see most of) get so few resources compared to characters. https://t.co/3Af3fn7XVe		@username 20k and 2048² on a gun, fine. But throwing the same on an enemy that you try to shoot before he gets too close?		@username Guns using the texture already in memory is good. Guns on the floor having the same model as FPS isn't. Probably LOD models.		@username I'm talking about chars that are small scale compared to enviro props. Extreme example: http://t.co/HOR8W8T2Pr 30~40tri scene		@username Dammit Crendor. You broke Jesse's game and made the audio go *poof*. Totally your fault.		@username @username I liken Esther to a movie. You can choose to progress or not, but not affect much else. But really, grey area.		Gamers unfazed, Sale has arrived!

Indy gamedev: Games are an artform! They belong in a museum!		@username @username @username 25 mbit here (get 22~23), for €10 in the Netherlands. Previous contract since '08 or '09 was €25, same speed.		@username On the flipside: half games for half prices...		Happy new years with an appropriately times new site!		Just played the first two episodes of Quake again, game's still tight. Loving the smooth movement.		So apparently paying €5 a month for Spotify makes me worse than a music pirate...? Dafuq? http://t.co/eP8m6V18Om		@username Wanted to say I appreciate the choice for minions. Should make the game feel nicely crowded, and give 'bad' players more fun.		@username Heh. I think it's funny you're apologizing for sound quality that's still better than, say, 90% of youtube game voiceovers.		I know this is cool and serious science, but it had me giggling like a kid. Best of both worlds!

That shit's golden, Telltale! http://t.co/Bs3VwRCRzd		@username Are you still looking for people? I can free up some time and be (almost) completely dedicated the next month(s).		@username I threw up some isometric examples at https://t.co/eBHrIdFtBJ (assuming you want to stick with the RPGmaker perspective)		@username Not many developers/companies would opt out of lots of money because something's addictive. I respect you for that.		Now that's a proper free to play Dungeon Keeper!		http://t.co/Am1vJnMrjr
I like this.		@username @username  How do they not help? I find it very useful to know if a game has been designed for touchscreen, controller or KBM.		@username Remember that fake Twitch-LoL video from this afternoon? Here's a REAL Twitch-Plays-Dota channel: http://t.co/LQdUtiWq2x		@username Thanks for reminding me/us to disable adblock for places I regularly visit. Because it's often a fairer trade that TV/radio.		Mini Metro http://t.co/XYeHJ47bGm Quite a novel idea: build your own growing metro system. Not sure about longevity/replayability, though.		@username How about keeping the same root word and call them BullVids?		@username Coil, because of its several experiments. Mirror's Edge, because of its absence. And whichever game started radial menus. Crysis?		@username Consider that a free game thrown in by the gods, for your generous purchases.		@username ""Luft"" means air, not red. And ""rauser"" probably stems from the Dutch verb ""rouzen"", playing wildly or ""razen"", rage/storm.		@username Did you guys just change all your youtube video thumbnails or have I not paid proper attention lately?		@username @username Do you also know about https://t.co/6SYVXc4GfN ?		@username Is this april fools or did they really start a website on April 1st with the plan of confusing people on -every- anniversary?		Whelp. @username wanted drama. He got drama. Can the devs get a nice game jam now, since that's what they wanted? #GAME_JAM		Great april fools joke! Anita Sarkeesian receiving ""GDC Ambassador award"" for making 5 videos in two years' time. http://t.co/Wjl343UZLU		@username For a moment I thought I was reading about a game from @username		@username Your avvy is now black/red/white. Does this mean future content will be in Betrayer-vision?		@username Hey I wanted to inform you that Potato Dungeon seems to be borked right now. Clicking to ride Pard doesn't work. For me anyways.		Not fond of new @username design. Discrover shows less per page, and the menu bar shows less lines so I must scroll to get to my playlists.		@username @username It's a carefully planned deal. He asked both for the exact same amount, so he's raking in cash but staying neutral.		Combine any random music term in youtube, it probably has it. Raprock. Acapella metal. Industrial Jazz. Celtic chiptunes. Gregorian dubstep.		@username I feel like I can 'express myself' less right now. It's all white. Will there be a way to change style besides just link color??		@username @username Harold and Kumar walk Down the Aisle. Because racial inclusivity, of course. ;)		Just crashed in to more bugs in 45 minutes on the bike, than in the past two weeks of game development.		Goddamnit I hate it when a commenting system forces you to first register, but meanwhile doesn't save your typed post. @username #lookingatu		@username is the new UI broken or just badly designed? I can no longer sort albums or search queries by name/artist/album/length/rating...		@username @username Yes. But only cool people.		Might be cool for portfolios: @username: Horizontal scrolling single page template (also on Github): http://t.co/hCc5D07nze  #html5 #css3		@username I wonder how many people realized what horrible things they sometimes say. Good luck, best wishes, and dump that lump!		Just rode past some kids biking ~25 km for some @username . I guess that's pretty healthy in the end?		@username If you sit like this and stare past your crotch, it probably is. But only barely .http://t.co/rHhCiJSBcH		@username Here's hoping this will wake people up a bit about greenlight / early access / kickstarter, right?		@username What you're saying is, you're now opening a P.O. box under the name of CynicalCox?		@username You hypocrite, you. Closing down your P.O. box for other companies but still accepting bribes from Polaris! Bias. BIAS!!		Yay mustasch! http://t.co/D0ZqTeL8z7		@username @username Jim is, in fact, a Drag King. In real life he is an ethereal spirit, but for his shows he dresses up as a man.		@username The point is not better because 'harder' but 'balanced against lame exploits'; it means you actually think/engage with the game.		This should be enough energydrink for at LEAST two days... http://t.co/vQVmlkjcot		Bad pixel shirts are one of those things that annoy and bother me more than they probably should... http://t.co/b6fC4bNsUA		@username So what do we call this kind of review score?

Ouch.		@username @username Whoa whoa whoa. Not JUST a black baseball cap, one with a VERY iconic stitchy liny logo thing! http://t.co/sKMmh2gi4z		@username @username Half-life? No, no. Carmack made Doom, Quake, Rage. Half-life is from @username.		@username @username WHY? IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM? ARE THE ADS TOO SILENT TO HEAR FOR YOU? WE ARE NOT HAVING THAT ISSUE.		Going to try and get something done for #lowrezjam 2014. 5 days left so it's gonna be tight. But I know what I'm gonna make: a 16x9 fighter.		@username I'm not seeing the problem with that #lowrezjam workfile. Looks perfectly usable. http://t.co/Pv9PpWSKRw		@username As long as everything is in nice sprite strips I'm happy. For small stuff like this panning around is easier than tabs/windows.		@username Face pulp, actually. I should probably have scaled up the image 200% =P. Heck I'm working small enough to make the game 200%		@username @username I'd like to know which devs you consider upstanding/trustworthy what with Nintendo greed, Watchdog graphics and 1/2		@username @username indies such as Towns and that recent plane game (air control?).

Host as much content as possible, have curated lists of 'the best', 'the new' 1/2		@username 'the interesting' and so on. Make it easier to navigate, empowering critics/users. Not curation, but promotion/navigation. (2/2)		@username Wow, this was great. I love simple games like these that require very little time/complexity to convey a strong idea.		@username Oh no! http://t.co/WEENVxgVcv is offline, as are the forums. Sound the alarms!

""That was God laughing at me, through that obscene giggle""		Getten toasty after French toast		You like mind games? We haven't even started to play.		Sitting on the bus trying not to bust out crying		Face facts. I just don't know what to say.		I just opened a drawer at work and had to ask myself where the fuck it and its contents came from.		Fuck today and its many shitty segues.		Wish I could get as high as my tolerance is right now.		Finally have some food and weed in me and starting to feel a little bit better. It's been such a long day.		While the mob is chanting ""Burn The Witch! Burn The Witch!!"" I'm the pagan at the back chanting ""Sacrifice The Virgin! Sacrifice The Virgin!		Realizing how much damage I've done to my legs through laziness in posture and proper walking :(		It's gonna take a lot of stretching to fix this #damagedone #itsalongroadback		Pruney fingers from so many dishes, but my kitchen looks sooo much better ????		Had everything set to go except I couldn't find my keys -.- I guess that's the universes way of saying I shouldn't go early today.		Bus is running late again ????		Start out describing how you feel about someone and you may end up rediscovering how you feel about them ????

My stomach is killing me, we have large numbers tonight and they're sending people home like crazy ????		Whatever to today.		Rodrigo's face when he hears how Giulia has ""righted her sin"" lmfao!! #borgia #latenight		Still dreaming of that white dress.		He was a Juan....

Tough times and tears all around ????		Oh goooooddddd. Washing my hair felt so fucking good #showertweet		So many fucking signs being thrown at me the past 2 days.... ????		This has been such a heavy 2 days. Wonderful and ugly emotions both, but its been an amazing 2 days.
